##Lineage Marker Analysis

This staining set includes the lineage markers KRT5 which is associated with basal cells and KRT19 which is associated with luminal cells. This analysis evaluates the lineage responses through a ratio of the median intensity of KRT19 to KRT5. 

The table that follows shows the first and last MEPs ranked by their lineage ratio.
