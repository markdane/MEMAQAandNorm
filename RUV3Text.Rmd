###RUVIII with Plate as Unit of Study

In the following plots RUV-3 normalization is applied to the `r x[["Signal"]]` signal of all spots with the plate as the unit of study. This creates an 8x5552 matrix of `r  x[["Signal"]]` spot values. The 694 spots in the A03 control wells of each plate are designated as negative controls. The faceted plots show normalizations at various k values.
