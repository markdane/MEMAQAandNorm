##Proliferation Analysis
The proliferation analysis methods is as follows:  
First, the cells within each well are gated into Edu+  
The proportion of EdU+ cells at each spot is calculated
The proportions are normalized by subtracting the median by the proportion of cells that are Edu+ in the plate's control well and then divding by the MAD of the plate's control well Edu+ proportion 
The normalized proportions are then summarized by the medians of their replicates.  
Plots show the distributions of the non-zero proportions and the proportions sumarized by ligand and ECM protein. A listing of the MEPs outside of the blue lines is in the supplemental material.  

The table that follows shows the first and last MEPs ranked by their EdU Proliferation Proportion.
